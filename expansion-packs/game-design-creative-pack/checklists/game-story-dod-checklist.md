## Validation Report

[[LLM: After reviewing all sections, provide a comprehensive summary:

1. Calculate overall pass rate (percentage of criteria met)
2. Identify the top 3 areas that need improvement
3. List any critical blockers that must be resolved
4. Provide specific recommendations for addressing failures
5. Determine if story is ready for development or needs revision

Use this format:

**Overall Assessment:** [Ready for Development | Needs Minor Revisions | Needs Major Revisions | Not Ready]

**Pass Rate:** X% (Y out of Z criteria met)

**Critical Issues:**

- Issue 1: Description and recommendation
- Issue 2: Description and recommendation

**Recommendations:**

1. Specific action to improve story quality
2. Another specific action

**Next Steps:**

- What needs to be done before story can be approved]]
