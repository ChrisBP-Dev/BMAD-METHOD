# Progression Systems Design Task

## Objective

Create compelling progression systems that provide meaningful advancement and long-term player engagement.

## Process

1. **Define Progression Types**

   - Character/player level progression
   - Skill trees and ability unlocks
   - Equipment and item progression
   - Collection and achievement systems

2. **Design Progression Curves**

   - Calculate XP requirements and timing
   - Balance effort vs. reward ratios
   - Create milestone and breakthrough moments
   - Design catch-up and retention mechanics

3. **Create Unlock Systems**

   - Design meaningful upgrade choices
   - Create branching progression paths
   - Establish gating and prerequisite systems
   - Balance horizontal vs. vertical progression

4. **Test and Balance**
   - Model progression pacing and timing
   - Test player motivation and satisfaction
   - Optimize for different player types
   - Validate monetization integration

## Deliverables
