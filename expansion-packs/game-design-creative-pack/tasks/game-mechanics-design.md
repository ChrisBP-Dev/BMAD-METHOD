# Game Mechanics Design Task

## Objective

Design core gameplay mechanics that create engaging, balanced, and intuitive player experiences.

## Process

1. **Analyze Game Vision**

   - Review game concept and target audience
   - Identify key gameplay pillars
   - Define success metrics for mechanics

2. **Design Core Mechanics**

   - Define primary player actions and interactions
   - Create mechanic specifications with clear rules
   - Design feedback systems for player actions

3. **Create System Interactions**

   - Map how mechanics interact with each other
   - Identify emergent gameplay opportunities
   - Design progression and complexity curves

4. **Balance and Refine**
   - Create mathematical models for balance
   - Design playtesting scenarios
   - Iterate based on feedback and data

## Deliverables

- Core mechanics specification document
- Interaction matrix between mechanics
- Balance calculations and formulas
- Playtesting protocol and metrics

## Success Criteria

- Mechanics are intuitive and learnable
- Systems create meaningful player choices
- Balance promotes fair and engaging gameplay
- Mechanics support long-term player retention
