- **Consistency Enforcement**: Establish review and approval processes

### Brand Alignment

- **Target Audience Consideration**: Visual style appeals to intended players
- **Genre Expectations**: Meet or deliberately subvert genre conventions
- **Platform Optimization**: Style works within technical constraints
- **Market Differentiation**: Unique visual identity in competitive landscape

## Color Theory Application

### Color Palette Development

- **Primary Colors**: 3-5 core colors that define the game's identity
- **Secondary Colors**: Supporting colors for variety and emphasis
- **Accent Colors**: Limited use colors for highlights and special elements

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Focus Direction**: Guide player attention to important elements
- **Information Prioritization**: Most important elements are most prominent
- **Balance and Weight**: Visual elements create pleasing compositions
- **Rhythm and Flow**: Consistent patterns create visual cohesion

### Spatial Relationships

- **Scale Consistency**: Objects maintain logical size relationships
- **Depth and Layering**: Clear foreground, midground, background separation
- **Negative Space**: Empty space used effectively for clarity and impact
- **Grid Systems**: Underlying structure for consistent layouts

## Character Design Standards

### Character Archetypes

- **Protagonist Design**: Relatable and aspirational character design
- **Supporting Cast**: Distinct silhouettes and memorable characteristics
- **Antagonist Design**: Visually communicates role and personality
- **NPC Design**: Functional and appropriate for world building

### Character Consistency

### Atmosphere and Mood

- **Lighting Design**: Lighting supports narrative and gameplay goals
- **Weather and Time**: Environmental conditions enhance storytelling
- **Texture and Material**: Surface treatments create believable worlds
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Visuals communicate narrative without text

## Technical Art Standards

### Asset Creation Guidelines

- **Polygon Budgets**: Efficiency standards for different asset types
- **Texture Resolution**: Appropriate detail levels for viewing distances
- **Optimization Requirements**: Performance considerations for target platforms
- **File Organization**: Naming conventions and folder structures

### Quality Assurance

- **Art Review Process**: Systematic evaluation of all visual assets
- **Style Compliance**: Regular checks against established style guide
- **Technical Validation**: Ensure assets meet performance requirements
