# Game Design Guidelines

## Core Design Principles

### Player-First Design

- Always prioritize player experience and enjoyment
- Design mechanics that empower rather than frustrate players
- Respect player time and provide meaningful progression
- Create clear feedback loops for player actions
- Ensure player agency in meaningful choices

### Accessibility and Inclusion

- Design for diverse abilities and play styles
- Provide customization options for different needs
- Use inclusive language and representation
- Consider cultural sensitivities in design decisions
- Test with diverse user groups

### Fun Factor Fundamentals

- Create compelling core gameplay loops
- Balance challenge with achievement satisfaction
- Provide variety to prevent monotony
- Design for both short sessions and extended play
- Foster sense of mastery through practice

## Mechanics Design Standards

### Core Mechanics

- Keep primary mechanics simple and intuitive
- Layer complexity gradually through progression
- Ensure mechanics are responsive and predictable
- Create meaningful consequences for player choices
- Design for emergent gameplay possibilities

### Control and Input

- Minimize input complexity for core actions
- Provide consistent control schemes across features
- Support customization for player preferences
- Ensure controls feel responsive and precise
- Consider platform-specific input methods

### Feedback Systems

- Provide immediate feedback for all player actions
- Use multiple feedback channels (visual, audio, haptic)
- Scale feedback intensity with action importance
- Maintain feedback consistency across game systems
- Design clear success and failure states

## Balance and Progression

### Difficulty Curves

- Start with accessible entry points
- Increase challenge gradually and logically
- Provide optional challenges for advanced players
- Include recovery mechanisms for struggling players
- Test difficulty with diverse skill levels

### Progression Systems

- Make advancement feel meaningful and earned
- Avoid pay-to-win scenarios in monetized content
- Provide multiple progression paths when possible
- Balance vertical and horizontal progression
- Create milestone moments for major achievements

### Economy and Resources

- Design sustainable resource generation and consumption
- Prevent exploitation through careful economic modeling
- Provide meaningful spending choices for players
- Balance scarcity with accessibility
- Consider long-term economic health

## Documentation Standards

### Design Documents

- Write clearly and concisely for diverse audiences
- Include visual aids and diagrams when helpful
- Specify measurable success criteria
- Document design rationale and decision factors
- Maintain version control and change tracking

### Iterative Design Process

- Plan for playtesting and feedback incorporation
- Document lessons learned from iteration cycles
- Maintain flexibility for design evolution
- Prioritize features based on player impact
- Establish clear approval and sign-off processes
